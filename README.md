# tinyraytracer-C

It is inspired from [tinyraytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer) by [ssloy](https://github.com/ssloy) which is written in C++. This is a C version of it. It is a very good tutorial for beginners to learn ray tracing. I have tried to keep the code as close to the original as possible. I have also added some comments to make it easier to understand. I have also added a Makefile to make it easier to compile and run.

## Requirements

-   C compiler
-   Make

## How to compile and run

```bash
make
./tinyraytracer
```

## Future work

I am planning to make this in OpenCL and CUDA.
